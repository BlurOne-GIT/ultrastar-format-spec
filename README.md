# UltraStar Format Specification
This specification contains a set of rules and requirements that dictate what an UltraStar textfile is and how each item should be interpreted.

## The problem
The idea for this specification came up within the [UltraStar* Creators Community Discord](https://discord.gg/tNEXZw2QJX) as we've been roaming free following some guidelines posted at many places on the internet for over a decade.
Many programs (creator software, website hosts and karaoke software) try their best effort to support the respective tags and NoteTypes to support all the features we want. But it's been long enough and we need to standardize things to sustain the future of our precious format.

Currently there are thousands of textfiles laying around unversioned and some with problematic tags which are hard to comprehend or built support for.
There are several communities out there who do not talk to eachother so it's hard to come up with a definitive system. Let's bond together and see if we can make the best out of this format we all love.

## The endgoal
The endgoal for this project would be to:
* [ ] Bring the different communities on par with eachother to increase the quality of the produced textfiles
* [ ] Versionise the format so we can improve and add features to it
* [ ] Give each Tag or NoteType a definition and how it should be working
